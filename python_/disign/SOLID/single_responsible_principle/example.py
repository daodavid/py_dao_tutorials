"""
If you need to modify the class for different reasons, this means something( an abstraction) is missing and you need to fix this.
The classes could have more than one method as long as they serve the same purpose
The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a function or a class should have one responsibility.
Following this principle will help keep your functions small and manageable.
Breaking this rule is sometimes justified, but the more you rely on an individual function to do, the more difficult it will be to understand, update, change, debug, or refactor it.

Letâ€™s say that I have a directory with files, and I need to access the data in those files.
Some of them are archived in .zip, .tar, or .gz formats, so I also need to extract those archives first.
