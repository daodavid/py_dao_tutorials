In Abstract Factory pattern an interface is responsible for creating a factory of related
objects without explicitly specifying their classes.
Each generated factory can give the objects as per the Factory pattern.
The Abstract Factory design pattern provides an interface for creating
families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
The factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass
with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class. This pattern
takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a class from the client program to the factory class.
